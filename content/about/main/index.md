  My current research interest is to investigate the skeletal muscle role in general health status. Therefore, I'm leading some research projects to determine the pivotal role of skeletal muscle in clinical outcomes such as hospital length of stay and the effects of exercise training on muscle mass and function in clinical populations and the mechanisms that control skeletal muscle plasticity.
  
  Additionally, I'm focused on developing my data science skills related to modeling statistics applied to health science. Thus, I have directed my studies to learn skills related to supervised and unsupervised machine learning using R language and Python.
