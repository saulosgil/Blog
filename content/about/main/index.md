  I'm focused on my data scientist career and, thus I'm working to improve my hard skills related to machine learning, especially deep learning.
  
  Also, I'm a researcher in the Applied Physiology & Nutrition Research Group from the University of Sao Paulo - Sao Paulo / Brazil in which I have investigated the skeletal muscle role in general health status and interventions to counteract muscle atrophy in catabolic conditions (e.g., bed-rest, obesity, so on).
