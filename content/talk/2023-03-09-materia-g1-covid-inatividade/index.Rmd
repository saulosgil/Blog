excerpt: COVID-19 pandemic is raising a devastating impact on public health, resulting in millions of hospitalizations and deaths globally. Among survivors, the high occurrence of patients reporting post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) is a great cause of concern, as it threatens health systems worldwide. Our main findings suggest that PASC is associated with physical inactivity, which itself may be considered as a persistent symptom among COVID-19 survivors. This may help in the early identifcation of patients who could beneft from additional interventions tailored to combat inactivity (even after treatment of PASC), with potential benefcial impacts on overallmorbidity/mortality and health systems worldwide..
