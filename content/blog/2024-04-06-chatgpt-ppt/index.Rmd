🧐Here's how:

## Step 1 - Create a script:

## Finally✔️

As noted, the use of generative AI can assist in creating slides that can be used in any presentation.

This AI-powered feature drastically reduces the time spent preparing slides from scripting to formatting slides, enabling faster and more efficient production of high-quality presentations.

Despite the efficiency of this resource, it is important to highlight that the content must be carefully reviewed by the person responsible for creating it, as highly technical and specialized content may not be adequately developed by AI.
