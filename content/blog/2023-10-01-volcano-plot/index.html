<h2>What’s that for??</h2>

<p>A volcano plot is a type of scatter-plot that is used to identify changes in large data sets. It is very used by bioinformatic researches when analyzing data from “omics” technologies (e.g., genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, metagenomics, phenomics and transcriptomics). It plots significance versus fold-change on the y and x axes, respectively. It enables quick visual identification of genes with large fold changes that are also statistically significant.</p>
<p>Briefly, in a volcano plot, the most upregulated genes are towards the right, the most downregulated genes are towards the left, and the most statistically significant genes are towards the top.</p>
<p>The R, especially the <strong>dplyr</strong> and <strong>ggplot2</strong> packages (both from Tidyverse), are very useful for creating beautiful and useful volcano plots.</p>
<p>Herein, I replicated the codes from a wonderful tutorial to create a volcano plot from <em>Erika Duan</em> which I strongly recommend see it for details <a href="https://github.com/erikaduan/r_tips/blob/master/tutorials/dv-volcano_plots_with_ggplot/dv-volcano_plots_with_ggplot.md">click here to acess!!!</a></p>

<h2>Packages required</h2>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)

<div id="import-a-test-dataset" class="section level2">
<h2>Import a test dataset</h2>
<p>Firstly, we need to access the dataset!</p>
<p>The dataset used to create volcano plot is from study of Fu et at. (2025) intitle <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25730472/">EGF-mediated induction of Mcl-1 at the switch to lactation is essential for alveolar cell survival</a>. This study explored the role and regulation of Mcl-1 in mammopoiesis and the RNA-seq dataset can be accessed and downloaded on this <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2529117#.X-_obzTis2w">site</a>.</p>
<p>But…I don’t understand anything about the topic!!!!</p>

<p>No problem, neither do I but we don’t need to understand it to create a beautiful Volcano plot!</p>

<p>As before mentioned, the volcano plot display the significance data (i.e., adjusted p-value) versus the fold-change [i.e., log2(Fold change)] on the y and x axes, respectively.</p>

</li>
<li>log_fc &lt;= -1 (i.e., downregulated);</li>
